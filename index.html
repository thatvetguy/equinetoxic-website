    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pet Toxic: Equine Edition</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic: Equine Edition is a reference application designed to help horse owners identify substances that may be harmful to equine animals. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection: None</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic: Equine Edition does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The app's toxicity database, veterinary glossary, and lab work reference guide are all bundled within the app and operate entirely offline. The app does not require an account, login, or internet connection to access its content.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horse profiles you create (including name, breed, date of birth, and optional photo)</li>
        <li>Vaccination records and care logs for your horses</li>
        <li>Your saved/bookmarked articles</li>
        <li>Your recent search history</li>
        <li>Your display preferences</li>
        <li>Your purchase status</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored entirely on your device and is <strong>never transmitted</strong> to us or any third party. We do not have access to any of this information. You can clear all app data at any time by deleting the app.</p>

    <h2>Analytics &amp; Tracking: None</h2>
    <p>The app does not include any analytics SDKs, crash reporting services, or usage tracking. There are no cookies, no device fingerprinting, and no data collection of any kind.</p>

    <h2>Advertising: None</h2>
    <p>The app contains no advertisements. There are no ad networks or ad tracking integrations.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic: Equine Edition offers optional in-app purchases to unlock additional features. All transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, receive, or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. The only external service involved is Apple's App Store for purchase processing. The app provides phone numbers for poison control hotlines; when you tap these numbers, your device's phone app will open. These calls are handled entirely by your device and carrier.</p>

    <h2>Veterinary Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Pet Toxic: Equine Edition provides general informational content about substances that may be toxic to equine animals. The app does <strong>not</strong> provide veterinary medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users should always consult a qualified equine veterinarian for medical concerns.</p>
